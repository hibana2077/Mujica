### notes

#### Engineered cardiac microbundle time-lapse microscopy image dataset

- 150 frames of 512x512 pixels

#### Phase Contrast Time Lapse Microscopy Image Datasets with Human-Generated Ground Truths and Computer-Aided Cell Tracking Annotations

- shape is (1392, 1040)
- F0001 has 1013 frames (but looks like all in black)
